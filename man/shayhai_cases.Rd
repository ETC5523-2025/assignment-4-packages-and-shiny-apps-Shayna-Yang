\title{Simulated case-level HAI burden data}
\format{
A tibble-like data frame with ~5,000 rows and 9 columns.
}
\source{
Calibrated to published summary estimates (German PPS).

}
\description{
A synthetic microdata table where each row is a single
healthcare-associated infection case. The dataset is calibrated
so that weighted totals reproduce published estimates of annual
infections, deaths, and DALYs for Germany (German PPS sample).
}
\details{
Columns:
\describe{
\item{case_id}{Unique simulated case ID.}
\item{infection_type}{Type of HAI:
\code{"HAP"} (pneumonia),
\code{"SSI"} (surgical site infection),
\code{"BSI"} (primary bloodstream infection),
\code{"UTI"} (urinary tract infection),
\code{"CDI"} (\emph{Clostridioides difficile} infection).}
\item{age_group}{Age band at infection (matching Figure 4 bins).}
\item{sex}{Reported sex ("Female","Male").}
\item{died}{1 if the case was estimated to result in attributable death,
0 otherwise.}
\item{yll}{Years of life lost (YLL) for this case.}
\item{yld}{Years lived with disability (YLD) for this case.}
\item{daly}{Total disability-adjusted life years (DALY = YLL + YLD).}
\item{weight_pop}{How many real-world annual cases this simulated row
stands for. Summing \code{weight_pop} across cases of a given infection
type gives the estimated national total number of cases for that type.}
}

Interpretation:
\itemize{
\item Summing \code{weight_pop * died} across rows approximates
annual attributable deaths by infection type.
\item Summing \code{weight_pop * daly} approximates total DALYs.
}

These totals match (to rounding) the values reported in the published
German PPS study for 2011.
