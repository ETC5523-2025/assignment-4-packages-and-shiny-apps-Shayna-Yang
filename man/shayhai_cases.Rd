\title{Simulated case-level HAI burden data (Germany)}
\format{
A data frame (tibble) with 5,000 rows and 9 columns.
}
\source{
Calibrated to published German PPS estimates.

\usage{

}
\description{
The dataset \code{shayhai_cases} contains 5,000 simulated
healthcare-associated infection (HAI) cases for Germany.
Each row represents one synthetic patient record.
}
\details{
Case weights are calibrated so that, when summed, they reproduce
the published national estimates from the German PPS study (2011):
total HAIs, attributable deaths, and DALYs.

Columns:
\describe{
\item{case_id}{Unique simulated case ID.}
\item{infection_type}{Type of HAI:
\code{"HAP"} (healthcare-associated pneumonia),
\code{"SSI"} (surgical site infection),
\code{"BSI"} (primary bloodstream infection),
\code{"UTI"} (urinary tract infection),
\code{"CDI"} (\emph{Clostridioides difficile} infection).}
\item{age_group}{Age band at infection, e.g. "65-74", "75-79", "80-84", "85+").}
\item{gender}{Reported gender ("Female", "Male").}
\item{died}{Indicator (1/0) for whether the infection was estimated
to result in an attributable death.}
\item{yll}{Years of life lost (YLL) assigned to this case.}
\item{yld}{Years lived with disability (YLD) assigned to this case.}
\item{daly}{Total disability-adjusted life years for this case
(\code{daly = yll + yld}).}
\item{weight_pop}{How many real-world cases this simulated row
represents. Summing \code{weight_pop} across cases of a given
\code{infection_type} yields the estimated annual number of HAIs
of that type in Germany.}
}

Interpretation:
\itemize{
\item \code{sum(weight_pop * died)} approximates the annual number of
attributable deaths for each infection type in Germany.
\item \code{sum(weight_pop * daly)} approximates the total DALYs
for that infection type.
}

These weighted totals reflect the German PPS study (2011).
