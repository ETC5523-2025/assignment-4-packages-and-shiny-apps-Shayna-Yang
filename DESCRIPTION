Description: A teaching-focused package for exploring the burden of 
    healthcare-associated infections (HAIs). It provides simulated datasets 
    and functions to summarise infection counts, attributable deaths, and 
    disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). The package also includes an 
    interactive Shiny app to visualise HAI burden by infection type, survey 
    module, and demographic group.
